This repository contains two short Magma files to generate
good codes from rational surfaces introduced in the article:

Alain Couvreur. Construction of Rational Surfaces Yielding Good Codes.
Finite Fields Appl. 17(5), 424-441. 2011. 

- File bestF7.mgm permits to construct a [57,12,34] code over F7
- File bestF9.mgm permits to construct a [91,18,53] code over F9

Both parameters are referenced on www.codetable.de
